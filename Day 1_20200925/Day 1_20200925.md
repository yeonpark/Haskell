# Decided to write down about my progress on programming as otherwise I don't think I will be self motivated improve myself.

Actually started looking on Haskell yesterday but didn't think of posting it so I'm just gonna start from today.

Took me some time for me to install ghci (haskell compiler) and preety much relied on this [guide](https://chocolatey.org/install).

Standard library functions that I learned on my first day are:
1. head - select the first element of a list.
ex) head[1,2,3,4,5] -> 1
2. tail - remove the first element from a list:
ex) tail[1,2,3,4,5] -> [2,3,4,5]
